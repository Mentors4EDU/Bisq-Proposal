> _This is a Bisq Network proposal. Please familiarize yourself with the [submission and review process](https://bisq.wiki/Proposals)._

<!-- Please do not remove the text above. -->

Background: In response to #330 having social trading, and me wanting to also do social trading for a while as well, I decided to work on this proposal. I think Bisq can utilize some variation of social trading and I have a general idea of features I would hope for.

# Overview
Bisq as a decentralized exchange has the potential for many social aspects and technological implementations. One of those aspects could be an integration of some form or variation of social trading. Social trading as a concept is open and transparent given the utilization of actual statistics and insights based off of skills or trading abilities. This proposal is on an open-source implementation of social trading on Bisq's network.
