<!-- Please do not remove the text above. -->

Background: In response to #330 having social trading, and me wanting to also do social trading for a while as well, I decided to work on this proposal. I think Bisq can utilize some variation of social trading and I have a general idea of features I would hope for.

# Overview
Bisq as a decentralized exchange has the potential for many social aspects and technological implementations. One of those aspects could be an integration of some form or variation of social trading. Social trading as a concept is open and transparent given the utilization of actual statistics and insights based off of skills or trading abilities. This proposal is on an open-source implementation of social trading on Bisq's network.

# Base Modules
There will need to be a series of modules and/or components integrated into this project. Having something modularly built will allow for easy upgrading, and I do take somewhat of an inspiration from the Bisq-2.0 proposals. If something isn't modularly built, not only is upgrading a hassle. For certain issues, debugging and mantaining over time can also be hectic.

## Profile
The profile needs to have just the basics. Optionally, it doesn't really have to have a profile picture but can denote some sort of icon given that a profile picture is just meaningless data storage. *(At least in this instance)*. It depends on the community's preference. What it will have will include a description, a link to website, and a button to view trade history. It will also include metrics in regards to percentages for YoY returns. There will be a follow trades button which the user can input a certain percentage such as the default commission being 5% or set a custom fee. The ability to chose between both fee and percentage can offer flexibility for many users.
